# Simple Todos App
Update: I was able to debugged last week's assignment. See below:
<h3>Note:</h3> 
~~I wasn't able to ~<code>meteor run ios</code> from the tutorial <a href="https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/running-on-mobile">(step 6)</a>.~~<br>
This was fixed by updating XCode from the App Store.<br>
~~The Private Mode for publishing did not work either <a href="https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/publish-and-subscribe">(step 10)</a>~~
