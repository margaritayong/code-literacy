# Simple Todos App

Update: I was able to debugged last week's assignment. See below:

###Note:### 

~~I wasn't able to ~`meteor run ios` from the tutorial[(step 6)](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/running-on-mobile).~~
This was fixed by updating XCode from the App Store.

~~The Private Mode for publishing did not work either [(step 10)](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/publish-and-subscribe).~~
